First we download the package that will help us about strong password management: sudo apt install libpam-pwquality

The first attack type that an attacker think will be  password cracking or pen-test! So a strong password is very significant.

Okey, how we will benefit from this package?
--> There will be a configuration text file in the '/etc/security' directory after installation of package and its name is 'pwquality.conf'. 
By editing this file, we will change our pc's (linux) password policies!

--> Editing process is simple! Only you need to do is to delete '#' sign from the policiy lines that you want to active it! 


In the example; we will activate the password length, the number of character class that made up the password and as last the number of repeating characters in the password.

Once we saved this file, if we want to create an account; the system will prompt a password according to this password policies! 
Free to try!
